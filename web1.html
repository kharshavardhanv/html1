<p>A <B>Blockchain</B> (or block chain) is a method of storing a list of entries, which cannot be changed easily after they are created. 
This also applies to the list.</p>
<p>This is done by using several concepts from cryptography, including digital signatures and hash functions. In very basic terms, a blockchain combines the following two ideas:</p>

<p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. </p>
<p>Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]</p>

<p>On the white summit of eternity<br>
A single Soul of bare infinities,<br>
Guarded he keeps by a fire-screen of peace<br>
His mystic loneliness of nude ecstasy.<br>
But, touched by an immense delight to be,<br>
He looks across unending depths and sees<br>
Musing amid the inconscient silences<br>
The Mighty Motherâ€²s dumb felicity.</p>
